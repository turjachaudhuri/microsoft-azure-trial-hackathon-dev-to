# microsoft-azure-trial-hackathon-dev-to

This application repository has been created to host the application code for the application developed in response to the Microsoft Azure Trial Hackathon on Dev .
You can find more details about the hackathon at - https://dev.to/devteam/hack-the-microsoft-azure-trial-on-dev-2ne5

There are many categories to select for in which you can deploy/choose your application.
They are -
1. AI Aces: Use Azure Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning services (ex: Azure Bot Service, Cognitive Search, Computer Vision, Custom Vision, LUIS, ML, etc) to build a new application.
2. Computing Captains: Use Azure Compute Services (ex: Azure Functions, App Service, AKS, etc) to build a new application.
3. Low-Code Legends: Use Azure low code/no code Fusion development services (with the Power Apps trial add-on) to build a new application.
4. Java Jackpot: Use Azure's Java services to build a new Java app.
5. Wacky Wildcards: Create a silly, weird, and/or totally random application using Microsoft Azure's services that doesnâ€™t fit into any of the categories above.

For my case , I have selected the category 2 - Computing Captains.

My application is a very simply voting application that is hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service .
The front end is created using HTML , and the tech stack is python .
It is inspired by the AKS tutorial published by MS as Open-Source , located at - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app

The application is a simple voting application that can let any user choose what is his favorite Public Cloud provider .
The application is hosted on AKS , and is accessible at - http://20.62.221.90/

The application looks like -
